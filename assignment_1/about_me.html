  <img src="mikedle.jpg" alt="Mike Le's picture" />

  
  <p>I am currently a Product Manager at Vulcun. In 2015, Vulcun offered the biggest prize pool in fantasy e-sports. I help manage the virtual economy, and monetization of virtual assets. In terms of products, I am starting a new project to boost the firm's presence in the streaming technology space.</p>
  <p>Prior to Vulcun, I worked in finance providing advice to small-cap and mid-cap companies on capital raising and M&amp;A transactions.</p>
  <p>During college, I helped manage a $1.0 million student-run portfolio, consistently outperform the S&amp;P 500 and Barlcays Bond index. My specialty includes Energy and Telecommunications. As a fund, we distribute 6% of our net asset value to Texas Christian University and the Department of Ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine. We have distributed over $2.8 million to our beneficiaries.</p>
  <p>I graduated from Texas Christian Unieristy with a Finance degree. I received the CFA Institute scholarship to be a member of the CFA Candiddate program and passed my CFA Level I exam in June 2012.</p>
