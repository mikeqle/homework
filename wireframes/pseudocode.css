/*- Initialize the game:
    Assign value to player credit
    Create a deck
----------------------------------*/

/*- Define that a card includes a suit (aces, diamonds, clubs, spades, etc.) and a rank (A, 2, 3, etc.)
*/

/*- A hand or a deck is an array of cards, we define these as Stacks
    Create stack functions:
    - Make a new deck: fill the deck with x number of cards
    - Deal: remove the top card of the Stack
    - Shuffle card: 
    - Count remaining cards
    - Add a card to the end of the stack
*/

/*- Make a new deck
    - Fill the Stack (array of cards) with all 52 cards in a deck * x number of decks used in a game of blackjack (normally 4 to 8 decks)
*/

/*- Deal
    - Remove the top card from the stack
*/

/*- Shuffle
    - Use a random function to move the order of the cards in a stack
*/

/*- Count
    - use len to count the length of the array (number of cards)
*/

/*- Add card
    - Add a card (most likely from another stack) to this stack (array)
*/
